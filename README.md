**The content in this repo should not see the sight of day**


This was my submission for the end of my A-Level studies. I had 0 coding experience at the time, only knew how to use arrays and if-else statements. I choose flask based off a few google searches and made a simple webapp, and a 90 page write up to achieve marks for the documentation. It was a very good learning experience and introduction to software development, but I don't recommend anyone uses the code in this repo.
