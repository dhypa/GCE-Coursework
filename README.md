# GCE-Coursework

This was my first ever fullstack project which I did for my A-level computer science coursework. I had 0 coding experience when I began this project and it does show in the code.......
The coursework consists of 2 parts, a 90 page write up and the application itself.

I did end up passing and I actually learnt A LOT about software development from this experience. The write up documents the development process, including talks with stake holders, choosing a development methodology, researching pre-existing solutions etc. HOWEVER, the application itself is not very good, and I do not recommend that anybody uses code from this repository. The project writeup is more reflective of what I had learnt from this. 

The application was built using flask.
